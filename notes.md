## 1.0 General Security Concepts
## 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls.
## • Categories
−Technical security controls / Logical security controls
security enforced by system / software
Examples: firewalls, encryption, MFA, antivirus, IDSs (Intrusion Detection System)
“done by machines / computers / implemented by technology”

−Managerial security control / Administrative controls
Policies, rules, governance, planning, reduce risk of security incidents
Examples: risk assessments, audits, approval processes, written policies, security policy, awareness trainings
“decided by management”

−Operational
Day-to-day human procedures, ensure equipment contrinues to work as specified,  implemented and executed by people
Examples: incident response, backups, training, configuration management, patch management
“people following process”

−Physical
Real-world protection of facilities, (deter, detect, and prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction of material assets)
Examples: locks, fences, guards, CCTV, Lighting, acess control vestibules, bollards, barricades
“protect the building”

## • Control types
−Preventive
Stops attacks before they happen
MFA, firewalls, locks, encryption, AV software (antivirus)

−Deterrent
Discourages attackers
Warning signs, visible cameras, lighting, fencing, bollards

−Detective
Finds attacks happening or after
IDS (Intrusion Detection System), logs, CCTV monitoring, security audits, vulnerability scanning

−Corrective
Fixes damage after an incident
restoring backups, patching systems, IRP (Incident Response Plan), DRPs (Disaster Recovery Plan)


−Compensating
Alternative control when main one isn’t possible
extra monitoring when encryption can’t be used, Backup power system, MFA, Application sandboxing, Network segmentation

−Directive
Guides behavior
policies, acceptable use rules, IRP (Incident Response Plan), AUP (Acceptable Use Policy)

## 1.2 Summarize fundamental security concepts.
• Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)
Confidentiality -> only authorized people see data (encryption, access control)
Integrity -> data is not alterd incorrectly (hashing, digital signatures)
Availability -> Systems are accessible when needed (redundancy, backups, failover)

•  Non-repudiation
Prevent denial of actions. Digital signatures ensure someone cannot deny sending a message

• Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
Authentication → “Who are you?” Password, biometrics, MFA
Authorization → “What can you do?” Permissions, roles
Accounting → “What did you do?” Logs, audit trails

• Gap analysis
Comparing where you are now vs. where you need to be, then identifying what’s missing to reach the desired security level.
